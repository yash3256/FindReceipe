# find-my-recipe
<br><br>
This website has been made for finding any recipes on the internet and finding restaurants around you if you're too tired to cook. 
I've used the Edamam API to fetch information about various recipes based on the query passed and displays them. 
I've also used OpenSourceMap to find restaurants nearby based on the location entered.
